# RFID_decoding

**From LinaHe  and  Yuchen Huang**

This is one of the assignement of Wireless Networking.

The decoding result of the signal is:

- The first signal from Reader (R1): 011111111111111111
- The first signal from Tag (T1): 1010V100110100000000000000000000110100101100000000011100010000101011011110001100000000000000000000000000000000000000001111000101100101
- The second signal from Reader (R2): 1100000111111111111111110011111110101011
- The second signal from Tag (T2): 100V11111111111111111

R1 starts from '01', which means this is a ACK command, the following 16 bits will be the RN16 generated by the tag. The reply from tag (T1) starts from '001', which is disallowed in the standard. So the following sigal will be ignored. The second signal from Reader starts from '11000001', which indicates this is a Req_RN command, and the following bits represent the RN16 and the CRC-16 for CRC check. After received the Req_RN command, the tag retransmitted the RN16.
